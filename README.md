# KPI Determination for Inventory Planning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **Power BI** dashboard to track key **inventory KPIs** and ensure efficient stock management. By monitoring actual versus expected inventory levels, analyzing **inventory turnover**, and applying **ABC analysis**, the project aims to optimize stock allocation and improve overall inventory management.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** for data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Excel** for data analysis and initial processing
- **SQL** for querying and managing inventory data

## Key Features
- **Dashboard for KPIs**: Tracks key inventory metrics like stock levels, inventory turnover, and days of inventory.
- **Comparison of Actual vs. Expected Inventory**: Identifies stock imbalances and discrepancies between forecasted and actual levels.
- **Inventory Optimization**: Analyzes inventory turnover and days of inventory to optimize stock levels.
- **ABC Analysis**: Classifies products based on sales impact, helping prioritize stock allocation.

## Key Insights & Achievements
- **Overstocked and Understocked Categories**: Identified areas of excess or insufficient inventory, enabling data-driven stock allocation decisions.
- **Improved Efficiency**: The project resulted in reduced excess stock and minimized shortages, significantly enhancing inventory management processes.

## Project Results
The analysis and dashboard developed in this project provided actionable insights that helped streamline inventory management, improve forecasting accuracy, and reduce stock imbalances, ultimately leading to improved operational efficiency.
